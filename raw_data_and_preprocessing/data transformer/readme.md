based on the mhd reading function by UVa course: Machine Learning in Image Analysis

note: you need to install **Mapping Toolbox** to run this program.

1. place two .m files in the root dictionary of data. (together with .mhd/.raw file)
2. run transformer.m
3. a new folder will be made and hold all .png file generated.



for the dataset:
